# About Me

I am dedicated to revolutionizing healthcare and improving health and wellness by advancing research and innovation in neuro-engineering and digital health technologies powered by machine learning, AI, and wearable technology.

I have over 10 years of leadership experience and over 20 years of scientific and clinical research and development expertise in wearable, biosensors, digital health, and neurotechnology. Applications of my work span remote health monitoring, movement disorders, neurorehabilitation, psychophysiological and cardiovascular effect of stress and relaxation, and overall health and wellness.
 
Throughout my career in academia and industry, I have honed my technical skills in neural and cardiac electrophysiology, data science, machine learning, algorithm development, and advanced analysis of clinical and biosensor data. 

I have an extensive clinical and scientific experience measuring, understanding, and improving physiological, health and wellness outcomes across diverse populations, including healthy and elderly as well as cancer survivors, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, autism, and cardiovascular disease patients.

I am a detail-oriented and cross-functional collaborator with excellent communication & interpersonal skills. I excel at identifying and nurturing individual talents while providing an environment and resource to foster self-development and personal growth. Given my strong technical background, I thrive in leading collaborative effort to solve complex technological challenges to drive research, innovation and product development success.
