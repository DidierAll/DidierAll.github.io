# About Me

My passion and mission are to improve health and wellness, by advancing research and innovation in neuro-engineering and digital health technologies, leveraging the power of data science, machine learning, wearables, and neuro-technology.

With more than 10 years of leadership experience and 20+ years of scientific, technical and clinical expertise in neural and cardiac electrophysiology, data science, machine learning, biosensors, neuroimaging and neurotechnology, I have spearheaded research and development innovations in remote health monitoring, movement impairment, neurorehabilitation, and digital health and wellness. 
 
In this effort, using technology and advanced analytics, I have led and collaborated on several clinical research and validation trials to measure, better understand and/or improve physiological, health and wellness outcomes in cancer survivors, in patients suffering from stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, autism, and cardiovascular disease, as well as in the general population. 

As an empathic leader, I am a detail-oriented and cross-functional collaborator with excellent communication & interpersonal skills. Leveraging my strong technical background, I have built high-performing teams to solve complex technological challenges to drive research, innovation and product development success.
