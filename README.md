# About Me

My passion and mission are to improve health and wellness, by advancing research and innovation in digital health technologies and neuro-engineering, leveraging the power of data science, machine learning, wearables, and neuro-technology.

With more than 10 years of leadership experience and 20+ years of scientific, technical and clinical expertise in neural and cardiac electrophysiology, data science, machine learning, biosensors, neuroimaging and neurotechnology, I have spearheaded research and development innovations in remote health monitoring, movement impairment, neurorehabilitation, and digital health and wellness. 

My technical and advanced analytical skills are complemented by an extensive experience designing and implementing clinical research and validation trials to measure and analyze physiological, functional and clinical outcomes in cancer, neurological disease (stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, autism), and cardiovascular disease, as well as in the general population.
