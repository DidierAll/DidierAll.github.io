## Movement Disorder and Rehabilitation in Neurological Disease

### Neurophysiological markers of Balance Deficit in Traumatic Brain Injury

As a co-Principal Investigator at the Kessler Foundation, this multi=investigator project investigates the neural and electrophysiology mechanisms of balance deficit and biofeedback training recovery in Traumatic Brain Injury using EEG, EMG, fMRI, dMRI and TMS. This work was funded by the NJ Commission on Brain Injury Research (9CBIR15MIG004)

This ongoing research effort has led to several manuscripts and conference presentations:

### Neural Biomarker of Movement Impairment in Stroke as a candidate for BCI

This research aims at identifying a specific biomarker whose magnitude scales with the level of force could help in the development of more effective, novel, highly targeted rehabilitation therapies such as brain stimulation or neurofeedback.

## Cancer-Related Weakness and Fatigue

This research effort at Kessler foundation has been to elucidate the central vs peripheral contribution to cancer related fatigue. Patients often complain of symptoms of fatigue following cancer or its treatment, often preventing them from resuming a fully active or functional life. Our research suggests that not only cancer patients experience (1) muscle fatigue faster in the early phase of a sustained or intermittent submaximal elbow flexion fatigue task as well as (2) shorter time to task failure due to greater central fatigue as evidenced by larger twitch force, a measure of peripheral fatigue at time of task failure.

## Psychophysiological and Health Detriment of Stress and Benefit of Relaxation

### The effectiveness and underlying mechanism of a Mindful Attention Program for Traumatic Brain Injury – A randomized clinical trial.
This ongoing rigorous randomized controlled trial conducted at kessler Foundation and funded by a National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) Field Initiated Grant (90IFRE0016) is evaluating the psycho-emotional benefit of mindfulness in Traumatic Brain Injury. It will assess the effectiveness of the mindfulness at improving attention and present moment awareness as well as emotional well-being and regulation, and social functioning. Using MRI neuroimaging, it will also investigate the neural mechanisms of improvement associated with attentional regulation.
